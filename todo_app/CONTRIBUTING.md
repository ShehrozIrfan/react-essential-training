2. You can contribute in terms of documentation:
   - By adding the documentation for the new `feature` you added, by creating the `md` file
   - A simple example can be found [here](https://github.com/ShehrozIrfan/react-essential-training/blob/master/todo_app/PAGINATION.md)

## Following the procedure you can make your contribution with ease.
### Step 0
Star and Fork this repository
### Step 1
Look in the issues section, if the change you are doing is available in the issues section and whether it is assigned to someone or not. If you can't find any issue then open one. I will assign you the issue then you can start contributing!
### step 2 Fork this repository
You can fork this repository by clicking on fork button on top right corner. Once you fork this will create a copy of repo on your account
### step 3 Clone the repository

> git clone <_URL you just copied_>
e.g. git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/react-essential-training.git

### step 4 Get into the Todo App folder
On your local machine go the project folder that you cloned, and then to get into Todo App folder, run the command:
`cd todo_app`

### step 4 Create a branch
Use following git command inside that folder

create a new branch using below command.

> git checkout -b \<branch-name\>
e.g. `git checkout -b mybranch`

### step 4 Lets make some contributions
Make changes to files on your local machine work on the issue you're assigned.

### step 5 Add Changes and Commit Changes
Now we have to add changes that we made to the branch so for that we will run following command.

> git add .
Now we have to commit changes, commit message should always be clear, to commit use command below.

> git commit -m "resolved the \<issue\>"
### step 6 Push changes to GitHub
Now we have to push the changes that we made to remote repository on specified branch to do so use command below.

> git push origin \<branch-name\>
name of branch is same as you created in step 3

e.g `git push origin mybranch`

### step 7 Submit your changes for review
Once you have pushed your code to GitHub, it's now time to create pull request, you will go to the repository click on compare and pull request and submit the pull request.

Soon, I will be merging all your pull requests to the main branch of project and you will also get notification once your pull request is merged with existing code base.
